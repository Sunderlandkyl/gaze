igtlGaze.py is meant to be using together with the GazePointer software which can be downloaded here (https://sourceforge.net/projects/gazepointer/).

After running GazePointer you would first calibrate then select 'Control Mouse Cursor'. Then run printcursor to continuously print out the cardinal location of your gaze. igtlGaze.py will send OpenIGTLink messages containing the region/gaze position data to any connected clients.
